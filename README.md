# ANGP(Aircrack-ng prompt)

A bash script to help make aircrack-ng easier to use

| Option | Description                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| -h     | Show help/info              |
| start     | Start prompts               |

## Installation
First clone the repository and then all you need to do is to move the `angp` file to somewhere in your `$PATH`.
The first time you run the script, it will check if you have the neccasary prerequisites.
You will need the aircrack suite, which you can aquire from <a href="https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng" target="_blank">https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng</a>.
