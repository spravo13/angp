| Option | Description                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| -h     | Show help/info              |

First clone the repository and then all you need to do is to move the `angp` file to somewhere in your `$PATH`.
The first time you run the script, if you don't have the neccasary prerequisites, it will guide you through aquiring them.
